# NextJS & Inversify project starter
This project is an example of NextJS & Inversify usages.

**It contains**:
- basic eslint & prettier setup
- basic jest setup with react testing library and jest
- examples of IoC usage for both server and client components
- an example of api routes usage

If you think something can be done better, just open an issue or @ me directly as this is just a fruit of my exploration.

- To run the project, run `npm i`
- To run the test suite, run `npm t`
- To check format and lint, run `npm run format && npm run lint`
- To format and fix lint problems, run `npm run lint:fix && npm run format:fix`
